# Stock Market Simulator
this is a stock market simulator that was made by my business teacher. that is it. 

ok so quick backstory on this one:
i was in a business lesson, and my teacher had us hop onto this stock market sim just because why not
and i just emailed myself the entire source code

FUTURE VISION:
1. add graphs when you click on a specific company
2. optimise for convinience
3. make it so you can choose to change how fast the stock market updates
